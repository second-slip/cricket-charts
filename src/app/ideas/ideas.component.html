  <P>
    This website is at a <span class="underline">very</span> early stage of
    development. Chart.js is used to create the charts. It is intended to make
    the charts a lot more interactive.
  </P>

  <P>
    The plan is to design charts covering cricket past and present. The current
    charts focus on the Test match career of James Anderson. Here's a few ideas
    I am working on:
  </P>

  <ul>
    <li>
      a comparison with Brian Statham, the other great post-war Lancashire Test
      bowler;
    </li>
    <li>an analysis of home and away Test performance; and</li>
    <li>comparison with other bowlers in his era.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Do you have any ideas? I would most welcome your feedback and any ideas for
    charts.

    <h2>Layout</h2>

    <p>I'm experimenting with the layout. These are the options on trial:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a routerLink="/">accordion</a> (the current default design) layout with
        charts divided into multiple collapsable panels;
      </li>
      <li>
        <a routerLink="/stepper">stepper</a> workflow with charts separated into
        steps; and the
      </li>
      <li>
        <a routerLink="/classic">classic</a> design with all charts in a simple
        series.
      </li>
    </ul>
