    <P>
        This website is at a <span class="underline">very</span> early stage of development. I am learning a chart
        library (Chart.js) that I've not used before. So I'm still getting to grips with its capabilities. I aim to make
        the charts a lot more interactive.
    </P>

    <P>
        The plan is to design charts covering cricket past and present. The current charts focus on the Test
        match career of James Anderson. Here's a few ideas I am working on:

    <ul>
        <li>a comparison with Brian Statham, the other great post-war Lancashire Test bowler;</li>
        <li>an analysis of home and away Test performance; and</li>
        <li>comparison with other bowlers in his era.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Do you have any ideas? I would most welcome your feedback and any ideas for charts.
